###How to find a suitable article to review

1. Reference lists - use the reference list of a good article to find related articles.
2. Reliable journals - page through favorite journals to look for interesting articles & keep up with what's going on. Goto libraries.
3. Popular press - less considered(MY INTERPRETATION)
4. Colleagues, professors and friends
5. **Current Contents** - a journal that consists of the table of contents of other journals.
6. **Citation Index** - a compilation of all the articles referenced by recently published articles; "forward reference".
7. Compilations of Abstracts - like Current Contents; published less frequently, contain title & abstract & summary.
8. Computer searches
9. Web searches - web crawler

###How to read scientific articles

For adequate understanding for an article, you should be prepared to read an article at least **two, three, or four times**.

For things you do not understand, they're because:

1. Lack of adequate background.
2. Just too complicated.
3. Do not make sense.

Preparation:

1. Looking up points made in references.
2. Looking up in textbooks.
3. Looking up words in dictionaries.
4. Asking questions.

Whether to read:

1. sufficient interest
2. relevance to the work
3. general importance
4. quality & accuracy
5. clearly written & accessibility
6. "meaty"
7. short
