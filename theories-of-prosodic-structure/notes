Theories of Prosodic Structure: Evidence from Syllable Duration
D.R. Ladd & W.N. Campbell, 1991

Abstract
---

Enrich the fixed hierarchy of prosodic domain types by allowing compound phrases.
    Marking the input text to identify both subordinate and superordinate major and minor tone-group boundaries.

Introduction
---

Factors affect duration:
  * Segmental differences(manners and place of articulation, vowel height, etc.)
  * Prosodic factors(degree of stress & position in phrase, etc.)
(fails)

To evaluate "there is no principled limit to the depth of prosodic structure"
    comparing the durational effect of phrase boundaries within and between 'compound phrases'

compound phrases: phrases that are themselves composed of two or more phrases

Materials & Procedures
---

Stress, accent-type, major & minor tone-group boundary locations
Each syllable was tagged with a number of identifiers
NN trained to predict the durations.
