Syllable-based segmental duration
W.N. Campbell, 1991

Abstract
---

A two-layered model of timing in speech.
    First stage: calculates syllable durations -> reflecting the rhythmic & structure of utterance
        * Neural net
          * duration pairs from natural speech
 >  Secondary stage: calculates segment durations, probability density distribution.

To test lengthening, durations of each token in DB were converted to standard normal form, to represent the amount of lengthening or compression.

Determining segmental durations
---

Ladd, D. R. & Campbell, 1991. "Theories of Prosodic Structure: Evidence from syllable duration".

Elasticity principle: all segments in a given syllable fall at the same place in their respective distributions.
Example:
    ae_u + t_u + k(ae_s + t_s) = 300
t = \sum_{i=1}^n e^{\mu_i + k\sigma_i}

Accommodating segments to syllable timings
---

An experiment was carried out to determine the extent to which the expansion or compression of each segment, measured in normalised terms, is uniform throughout the syllable.

* All vowels & syllabic consonants are tagged as peak.
* Consonants preceding the first vowel or syllabic consonant after a word boundary are tagged as onset.
* Consonant following the vowel and before a word boundary are tagged as coda.
* Polysyllabic words, internal consonants considered  are taggged as medial.

Syllabification of polysyllabic words:
 * A single medial consonant was assumed to be preceded by a syllable boundary, functioning as onset.
 * A pair of medial consonants -> onset, coda.
 * A cluster of three+ medial consonants -> syllable boundary between second and third.

Syllables were grouped into 3 classes of length.
