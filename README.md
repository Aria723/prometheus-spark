> ### Learn or die.

In late 2014 I initiated an effort to review and learn from old speech synthesis papers.

* The first stage of which was to meta-learn how to learn.
    * Robert Siegel's Reading Scientific Papers was picked as a random starting point. Notes were taken [here](https://github.com/Sleepwalking/prometheus-spark/blob/master/reading-scientific-papers/notes.md).
* The second stage of which was to read Julius Smith's [Spectral Audio Signal Processing](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/).
    * There was an attempt to track down how the chapters and sections were interrelated.
* Now I had bootstrapped into the third stage which was to actually read papers.
* In about a year I started to write my own stuffs. Under [`writings/`](https://github.com/Sleepwalking/prometheus-spark/tree/master/writings) there are reviewed, unreviewed, published and rejected papers. *All papers were drafted equal.*
